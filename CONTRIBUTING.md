# How to Contribute to this Repository

Before contributing to this specific repository, please read the [Contribution Guidelines](https://nrkno.github.io/sofie-core/docs/for-developers/contribution-guidelines) for the Sofie project.


## Branches
This repository uses the following branches:

* **_master_** is our main branch. We consider it stable and it is used in production.
* The **_releaseXX_** branches are our in-development branches. When a release is ready, we decide to “freeze” that branch and create a new **_releaseXX+1_** branch.

We encourage you to base your contributions on the latest **releaseXX** branch, alternatively the **master** branch or a recently frozen **releaseXX** branch. The [Sofie Releases](https://nrkno.github.io/sofie-core/releases) page collects the status and timeline of the releases.
